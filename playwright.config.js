  // generic "Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded while setting up 'page'"

  // live: no real browser has ever launched in this suite's default run. Down to a single project,
  // renamed from 'chromium' to 'client' -- Playwright requires every test to belong to a named
  // project (it's a structural requirement, the name itself has no effect on what runs, and the
  // fixture ignores `use.browserName` entirely either way), but the reporter prints whatever that
