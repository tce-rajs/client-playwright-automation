// Module -> confirmed-working Class/Division/Subject/Chapter/Topic map.
//
// Reference: D:\Projects\automation-cep-cypress\cypress\config\moduleClassMap.json
// (a flat, single-account JSON of grade/division/subject/chapterIndex/
// topicIndex per module, built by that Cypress suite). This is the "next
// level" version for this project, built FROM this project's own actual
// code (every resetToClass/goToChapterTopic(ByName) call across tests/,
// extracted live rather than typed from memory) rather than duplicating
// the reference by hand. Two structural upgrades over the reference:
//
//   1. TWO accounts, not one. This project uses two real, independent
//      teacher logins (VALID_PIN and VALID_PIN_2, see .env) to allow
//      parallel work without state collisions -- every entry below
//      records which account it was actually confirmed against, since a
//      combo confirmed on one account says nothing about the other.
//   2. `knownIssues`, not just a free-text `notes` string. Real,
//      reproducible findings tied to a SPECIFIC class/module combo
//      (crashes, popups that misbehave, data that doesn't render) are
//      recorded as a structured list here, so a future test/agent can
//      check `knownIssues.length > 0` programmatically instead of having
//      to re-read prose to notice a landmine.
//
// Usage:
//   const { applyClassMap } = require('../../config/moduleClassMap');
//   await applyClassMap(nav, 'quiz'); // logs in is NOT done here -- callers
//                                      // still do pl.loginWithPin() first,
//                                      // since the map only owns navigation.
//
// Keep this file in sync by construction, not by memory: whenever a test
// discovers a new confirmed-working (or confirmed-BROKEN) class/chapter/
// topic combo for a module, add/update the entry here rather than letting
// another hardcoded resetToClass(...) call drift out of sync with this map.
